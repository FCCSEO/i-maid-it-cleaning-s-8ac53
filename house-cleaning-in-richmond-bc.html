      "reviewBody": "I was messaging many different cleaning companies on Facebook when I stumbled upon IMadeIt Facebook account page.\n\nJust like any of my previous messages to other companies I told the owners of IMadeIt the exact same thing I needed done from the job. It was a tall order. On top of that, I asked him a favour at point blank and the owner took it without hesitation.\n\nWell, I asked him to quote a deep cleaning job for my unit in Abbotsford but first he must visit the place and take a look at the unit before I honour him the contract because I knew this particular job couldn’t have been done properly without being assessed in person. And so, he said yes and he took off and drove straight to Abbotsford without talking about numbers yet.\n\nThat’s real honest work. A lot of the cleaning companies I reached out to gave me generic quotes without even assessing the amount of work. I could easily tell that they’re only gonna do the most basic cleaning job and clearly that’s not what I was looking for.\n\nAs a client, nothing is more annoying than not being heard. You could be the best cleaners out there but if you don’t have the right tools for the job then you wouldn’t be able to do the job right. That’s how I could tell apart amateurs between professionals.\n\nLuckily, I hired a professional and I’m really thankful for that.\n\nOut of all the companies I reached out to Jasper was the only one who listened to what I was looking for.\n\nWhen he got there, he immediately assessed the place and then gave me a proper quote for the job later that afternoon. I did have some expectations of the actual cost yet he priced it fairly (not cheap but not expensive either). The amount of work was truly extensive.\n\nHe told me it’s going to take them 6 hours and it did take them 6 hours to do the whole unit. It’s only 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom but the workload is enormous. I’m honestly surprised it only took them 6 hours.\n\nOnce the job is done, we did a walkthrough and they ticked all the boxes. They were very professional from start to finish. I was quite impressed by the quality of work but it is to be expected from their price point. I would totally hire them again for deep cleaning work because they’re willing to take an extra mile to satisfy my needs. I highly recommend these guys for any clients looking to do a deep cleaning job of their place.\n\nThey are the real definition of you get what you pay for. Worth every penny.",

They cleaned our condo top to bottom to include oven door, glass showers, mirrors, interior windows etc...they brough all their own supplies and took every-thing with them when they left. They were kind and listened to us a customers about our cleaning needs and expectations. Highly recommended cleaning service.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">I was messaging many different cleaning companies on Facebook when I stumbled upon IMadeIt Facebook account page.

Just like any of my previous messages to other companies I told the owners of IMadeIt the exact same thing I needed done from the job. It was a tall order. On top of that, I asked him a favour at point blank and the owner took it without hesitation.

Well, I asked him to quote a deep cleaning job for my unit in Abbotsford but first he must visit the place and take a look at the unit before I honour him the contract because I knew this particular job couldn’t have been done properly without being assessed in person. And so, he said yes and he took off and drove straight to Abbotsford without talking about numbers yet.

That’s real honest work. A lot of the cleaning companies I reached out to gave me generic quotes without even assessing the amount of work. I could easily tell that they’re only gonna do the most basic cleaning job and clearly that’s not what I was looking for.

As a client, nothing is more annoying than not being heard. You could be the best cleaners out there but if you don’t have the right tools for the job then you wouldn’t be able to do the job right. That’s how I could tell apart amateurs between professionals.

Luckily, I hired a professional and I’m really thankful for that.

Out of all the companies I reached out to Jasper was the only one who listened to what I was looking for.

When he got there, he immediately assessed the place and then gave me a proper quote for the job later that afternoon. I did have some expectations of the actual cost yet he priced it fairly (not cheap but not expensive either). The amount of work was truly extensive.

He told me it’s going to take them 6 hours and it did take them 6 hours to do the whole unit. It’s only 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom but the workload is enormous. I’m honestly surprised it only took them 6 hours.

Once the job is done, we did a walkthrough and they ticked all the boxes. They were very professional from start to finish. I was quite impressed by the quality of work but it is to be expected from their price point. I would totally hire them again for deep cleaning work because they’re willing to take an extra mile to satisfy my needs. I highly recommend these guys for any clients looking to do a deep cleaning job of their place.

They are the real definition of you get what you pay for. Worth every penny.</div>
